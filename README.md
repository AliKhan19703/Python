# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack (also known as 21) in Python.

## Description

Blackjack is a popular card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. In this Python implementation, you can play Blackjack against the computer (dealer).

## Features

- Player vs. computer gameplay.
- Simple command-line interface.
- Automatic card dealing and scoring.
- Support for basic Blackjack rules, including hitting and standing.

## How to Play

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
4. Run the `blackJack.py` file using Python: `python blackJack.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules

- The player and the dealer are both dealt two cards initially.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, Aces are worth 1 or 11 points (whichever is more favorable), and all other cards are worth their face value.
- The player can choose to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (end their turn) to try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
- After the player stands, the dealer reveals their second card and continues to hit until their total is 17 or higher.
- The player wins if they have a higher total than the dealer without exceeding 21, or if the dealer busts.
- The dealer wins ties.

## Usage

- You can modify the game logic or add new features by editing the `blackJack.py` file.
- Feel free to customize the game's appearance or add additional functionality as needed.
